What WHO is doing in the area of health systems financing

WHO works with countries to devise ways of raising more funds for health equitably, to use the available funds efficiently, and to monitor the use of funds. It works with the international community to try to raise more, and more predictable funds for health.

Many countries need to use available funds more efficiently and raise more funds from domestic sources, but these measures would be insufficient to fill the current gap in the poorest countries. Only an increased and predictable flow of donor funding will allow them to meet basic health needs in the short to medium term.
