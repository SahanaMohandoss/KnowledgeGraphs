Key facts

The health of women and girls is influenced by sex-linked biology, gender, and other social determinants.
Women live longer than men. In 2016, global life expectancy at birth was 74.2 years for females and 69.8 years for males.
However, women experience more morbidity and use health care services more than men, especially linked to reproductive health needs.
Noncommunicable diseases remain the biggest killer of women globally, accounting for 18.9 million global deaths in 2015.
Cardiovascular disease is the top cause of women’s death. Among cancers, cervical and breast cancer are the most common, and lung cancer is the leading cause of death.
Depression is more common among females (5.1%) than males (3.6%) [1]. Unipolar depression is twice as common in women [2].
Self-harm, including suicide, occurs throughout the life course and was the second leading cause of death globally among females, aged 15–29, in 2015 [3].
Globally, in their lifetime, one in three women are likely to experience physical and/or sexual violence [4].
Women and girls in areas of conflict and displacement suffer disproportionally as a result of disruption of health systems, exacerbation of barriers to health care, and the use of rape and other forms of violence as weapons of war.
Every day, approximately 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth [5].
Women, especially young ones aged 15–24 years, represent a majority of people living with HIV [6].
In households and communities, women are the primary source of caregiving [7].
Female health workers comprise 70% of the health and social workforce worldwide, yet half of women’s contributions to global health are in the form of unpaid care roles, equivalent to US$ 3 trillion annually [8].  



Introduction
Sex refers to the biological characteristics that distinguish females and males. Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles, power and relationships.
 

Gender inequality is a root cause of inequitable health outcomes for women and girls.
 


Infancy and childhood (0–9 years)

Prematurity, birth asphyxia and infections are the main causes of death during the first month of life. The causes of death are similar for both sexes during infancy and childhood.
 
In certain cultures, however, gender-based discrimination disadvantages girls through sex-selective abortion and female infanticide.
 
An estimated 18% of girls are sexually abused at some point in their childhood, relative to 8% of boys.[9]
 
In some settings, girls have more limited access to vaccines, health services and good nutrition than their male counterparts[10]. “Son preference” may lead to shorter periods of exclusive breastfeeding for girls.
 
 
Adolescence (10–19 years)
Adolescence is when sex differences become more apparent, and gender-based norms begin to take shape. The main causes of death worldwide among all adolescents are road-traffic accidents, self-harm, and drowning.
 
The top causes of death for female adolescents aged 15–19 years are maternal conditions, self-harm, road injury, diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections.[11] Depressive disorders, linked to self-harm and suicide, are leading causes of ill health among adolescent girls.
 
Adolescent girls experience a greater risk of sexual abuse while also confronting harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation.
 
The majority of girls become sexually active during their adolescent years. They are often coerced or forced to have sex and experience other forms of gender-based violence.
 
Each year, about 15 million girls are married before the age of 18 years.[12],[13],[14],[15] Child marriage has serious consequences for girls’ educational attainment, and that of their children.[16],[17],[18]
 
About 16 million girls aged 15–19 years and some 1 million girls under 15 years give birth every year, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 3 million unsafe abortions occur globally every year among this age group.
 
Globally, adolescent girls and young women account for two out of three new HIV infections.[19]
 
Iron-deficiency anemia accounts for a substantial portion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) among adolescent girls.
 
Increasingly, nutritional problems during childhood and adolescence are related to overweight and obesity, which are associated with a higher risk of premature death and disability in adulthood.[20]
 
Eating disorders are most prevalent among adolescent girls. Anorexia nervosa is the most common eating disorder and the mental health condition with the highest mortality.[21]
 

Adolescent girls are increasingly using tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, which could compromise their health during that period and later in life, and the health of their children.[22] 
 

Reproductive Age (15–49 years) and Adulthood (20–59 years)
For women aged 15–49 years, HIV and tuberculosis represent major health threats.
 
Conditions associated with pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period are an important source of morbidity and mortality. Every day approximately 830 women of reproductive age die from obstetric complications.[23]
 
Maternal morbidities, including perinatal depression, obstetric fistula and other complications from obstetric procedures, are 20 times more common than maternal deaths. 
 
Access to and control over safe and effective contraceptive methods prevent unintended pregnancies and support healthy spacing.
 
Major noncommunicable diseases are the leading causes of adult women’s death and disability.  Women are more at risk of depression and anxiety than men. Peripartum and postpartum depression severely affect women and their children.
 
Worldwide, the top five most common types of cancer among women are breast, lung, colorectal, cervical and stomach.  Tobacco use, exposure to second hand smoke, and the burning of solid fuels for cooking are the primary risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. These risk factors and exposures are in turn influenced by social norms related to gender, such as behaviours, occupation and location [24].  
 
Low back pain, ischemic heart disease, stroke and major depressive disorders are the top causes of DALYS for women aged 45–59 years. There is evidence that women tend to be diagnosed and treated later and less aggressively than men for cardiovascular disease.  
 
Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence against women.[25] Such violence has profound impacts on women’s physical, sexual, reproductive and mental health.
 
 
Women 60 years and over
Healthy ageing should be defined by the quality of health and well-being, without stigma or discrimination. Regardless of where they live, the biggest killers of women at this life stage are heart disease, stroke, and chronic lung disease.
Women over the age of 65 have much higher rates of injuries due to falling than men – possibly related to osteoporosis and other underlying chronic conditions.[26]
 
Dementia is more common among women than men in this age group.
 

Given their longer life expectancy and dominant gender norms, women often assume caregiving roles for their male partners and other family members at the end of life.
 

Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development

Health is a human right for all and ensuring universal health coverage without impoverishment is the foundation of achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all people receive the health services they need without facing financial hardship.
 
Gender affects men and women differently. Out-of-pocket payments on user fees can severely constrain access to health care for widows, and women heads of households.
 
The dynamic health impacts of climate and environmental change are not gender-neutral. Women and girls are more vulnerable to environmental risk factors such as contaminated water and household air pollution. Women and girls also experience an increased risk of death during natural disasters and experience added vulnerabilities in humanitarian crises, where they are often victims of rape, at heightened risk of intimate partner violence and trafficking, and may lack access to essential health care.
 
Comprehensive health care throughout life is still not available for most women, and urgent action is needed. By adopting a person-centered approach to health across the life-course, women and girls become active participants in their health.
 
Women contribute more to health than to any other sector and must be recognized and valued for their contributions. Addressing gender biases and inequities in the health and social workforce is key to achieving universal health coverage and the SDGs.
 
 
WHO response
WHO is working to improve women’s health by strengthening the delivery of, and access to, all services. This includes sexual and reproductive health issues such as maternal care, as well as access to integrated services for HIV and tuberculosis and preventing gender-based violence, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, obesity. WHO is also working to reduce risk factors, promote mental health, and improve the lives of women with disability.
 
Working with Member States, WHO is strengthening the capacity of health care providers and of the health system to respond to violence against women and sexual abuse of children and adolescents by implementing the Global plan of action on strengthening the role of the health system to address violence, in particular against women and girls and children.
 

Global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children

 
WHO works to strengthen measurement of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) indicators in countries, including maternal mortality and morbidity, abortion, and violence against women, among others. 
 
WHO is working with Member States to accelerate their efforts to improve the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents through the implementation of the Global Strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health (2016-2030).
 

Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016-2030)

 
The Organization fully supports the principles of "Every woman every child”, including approaches in humanitarian settings and other health emergencies with adherence to gender-sensitive programming.
 

Every woman every child

 
WHO is enhancing its response to gender-based violence in emergencies through training and awareness-raising in countries with ongoing operational responses and research.
 
WHO is working with professional organizations, academia and Member States to ensure a ‘positive childbirth experience’ with respect and dignity for every woman by inclusion in making decisions about the care they receive during labour and birth.
 
WHO is working to improve the health of older women and focuses on implementing the five strategic priorities of the Global strategy and action plan on ageing and health 2016-2020, while strengthening health and long-term-care systems for older people, in which women make up the majority of the workforce. 
 
WHO is supporting member states together with the International Labour Office (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote the development, financing and implementation of gender-transformative workforce strategies to overcome gender biases and inequities in the health and social workforce.
